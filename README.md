## Introduction
This project was a 2 day sprint to create anything I wanted.

I decided to create JSONShare, a file sharing website, as that was always a subject that had interested me. I had a lot of challenges in getting it running in just two days but a couple of late nights later it all came together and I couldn't be happier with it.

In the future, I would like to enhance security by adding email verification to ensure that every account has a real email behind it and requiring that passwords contain upper case, lower case, numbers and special characters.

Another thing I want to implement is the ability for the server to automatically prune files as they age as the server is currently hosted with only 30gb in storage space.

## What does the app do?
* Allows users to register for a free account and upload any files they want up to 50mb.
* Each users files are stored separately so that if user A and B upload the same file and user A deletes it, user B will still have access.
* Users can see a card based display of every file they have uploaded, and have access to a link that anyone can use to download.
